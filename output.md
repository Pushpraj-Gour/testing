Purchase Decision-Making and Channel Preferences The user research for Kurlon reveals a complex interplay between online and offline channels throughout the customer journey, with distinct preferences and behaviors across different demographic segments. Several key themes emerge: 1.

Kurlon's success stems from its ability to cater to diverse needs, offering a range of products that balance these factors. To maintain its market position, Kurlon should continue emphasizing comfort and value while addressing emerging priorities like health benefits and temperature regulation. 2. Omnichannel Research and Purchase Behavior: Customers engage in a dynamic research process that combines online and offline sources. While online platforms serve as a starting point for research and comparison, the tactile nature of mattresses makes offline experiences crucial in final decision-making. Younger, tech-savvy consumers lean towards online sources, while older consumers and those making high-value purchases rely more on in-store experiences. This highlights the need for Kurlon to develop a seamless omnichannel strategy that caters to diverse preferences. 3. Critical Role of In-Store Experiences: Physical store visits and salesperson interactions often serve as the tipping point in purchase decisions, even for customers who begin their search online. The ability to examine products, receive personalized recommendations, and get immediate answers significantly influences customer confidence. This is particularly important for budget-conscious, health-focused, and family decision-makers. Kurlon should invest in comprehensive staff training, create inviting store environments, and implement confidence-building policies like trial periods to leverage this aspect of the customer journey. 4. Offline Purchase Preference with Online Research: Despite the importance of online research, there's a strong preference for offline mattress purchases across demographic groups. This is driven by the need for tactile experiences and immediate feedback. To address this, Kurlon could explore innovative solutions like virtual reality experiences or more comprehensive online product information to bridge the gap between online research and offline purchases. 5. Impact on Customer Satisfaction and Brand Loyalty: The multi-channel approach significantly influences customer satisfaction, decision-making, and brand loyalty. While online channels are crucial for initial research, the in-store experience remains key to final purchase decisions and overall satisfaction. To capitalize on this, Kurlon should focus on enhancing their online presence, improving online-offline integration, investing in in-store experiences, and developing a robust omnichannel customer support system. These insights suggest that Kurlon's strategy should focus on creating a seamless, integrated experience across all channels, tailoring approaches to different customer segments, and leveraging the strengths of both online and offline touchpoints. By addressing these areas, Kurlon can optimize its multi-channel strategy to better meet customer needs, leading to increased satisfaction, more informed decision-making, and stronger brand loyalty.

However, the research reveals a complex landscape of diverse customer needs and expectations, presenting both challenges and opportunities for the brand. A recurring theme is the importance of personalization and segmentation. Kurlon's customers exhibit varied preferences for comfort, support, and features, largely influenced by factors such as age, health concerns, family situation, and lifestyle. This diversity underscores the need for a wide product range and tailored marketing strategies to effectively address different customer segments.

The emphasis on back and spine support, particularly among health-conscious consumers, highlights an opportunity for Kurlon to strengthen its position in the health and wellness segment. While Kurlon generally receives positive feedback, some areas for improvement are evident. Heat retention, initial adjustment periods, and limited waterproofing are cited as drawbacks. Addressing these issues through product innovation could significantly enhance customer satisfaction and differentiate Kurlon in the market. The research indicates strong potential for Kurlon to expand into additional sleep-related products, particularly pillows and protective bedding. The brand's established trust provides a solid foundation for this expansion, though success will depend on maintaining quality standards and competitive pricing. An interesting insight is the varying awareness and perception of Kurlon's warranty and after-sales services across different customer groups. This suggests an opportunity to improve communication and tailor service offerings to different segments, potentially strengthening customer loyalty and brand perception. Innovation emerges as a key area for focus, with customers expressing interest in advanced materials, health- oriented features, customization options, and integrated accessories. By addressing these unmet needs, Kurlon can appeal to a broader range of customers, from tech-savvy consumers to health-conscious individuals. Overall, the research paints a picture of a brand with a strong foundation but facing the challenge of meeting increasingly diverse and sophisticated customer needs. By leveraging its strengths in quality and affordability while investing in innovation and personalization, Kurlon has the potential to significantly enhance its market position and customer satisfaction across various segments.

While online platforms provide a starting point for research and comparison, the tactile nature of mattresses means that offline experiences remain crucial in the final decision-making process. Different demographic groups show varying preferences in their research methods, with younger, tech-savvy consumers leaning more towards online sources, while older consumers and those making high-value purchases tend to rely more on in-store experiences. To better serve their diverse customer base, Kurlon could consider: 1. Enhancing their online presence with detailed product information, comparison tools, and customer reviews to cater to tech-savvy researchers. 2. Improving in-store experiences with knowledgeable staff and interactive displays to satisfy customers who prefer physical product interactions. 3. Developing a seamless omnichannel strategy that allows customers to easily transition between online research and in-store experiences. 4. Tailoring marketing messages and channels to specific demographic groups based on their preferred information sources and research patterns. Further research could explore how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected these research and purchase patterns, and whether the shift towards online research is likely to persist or evolve in the post-pandemic era. Synthesized Insights The research and information-gathering process for mattress purchases among Kurlon customers reveals a complex interplay between online and offline sources, with distinct patterns emerging across different demographic groups. This analysis synthesizes insights from multiple interviews to provide a comprehensive understanding of how customers approach their mattress purchase decisions. 1. Research Methods and Information Sources Online Research A majority of Kurlon customers begin their mattress research process online. This trend is particularly evident among younger, tech-savvy consumers and working professionals. Key online research methods include: E-commerce Platforms: Many respondents mentioned using Amazon and Flipkart to compare prices, check product specifications, and read customer reviews. For example, Neha (Interview 9) and the couple from Interview 12 both used Amazon for initial research. YouTube: Several interviewees, such as the couple from Interview 1 and Aishwarya and Nikhil (Interview 12), used YouTube to search for "Best quality mattress" videos and learn about different types of mattresses and materials. Brand Websites: Some customers, like those in Interview 2, visited official brand websites to gather information about specific mattress models and features. Social Media: Platforms like Instagram and Facebook were used by some respondents, particularly younger ones, to follow influencers and gather lifestyle-related information that indirectly influenced their mattress choices. Offline Research Despite the prevalence of online research, many customers still rely heavily on offline sources for information and decision-making. This is especially true for older consumers and those making high-value purchases. Offline research methods include: Store Visits: Almost all respondents visited physical stores to see and feel the mattresses before making a purchase. For instance, the couple from Interview 7 visited 7-8 multi-brand stores in their area. Recommendations from Friends and Family: Many interviewees, such as those in Interview 13, relied on recommendations from relatives who had used different mattress brands. Salesperson Interactions: In-store conversations with salespeople provided valuable information about mattress features, materials, and brand comparisons. This was particularly important for customers like Balaji (Interview 15), who preferred immediate answers to their questions. 2. Influence of Online and Offline Sources on Different Demographic Groups Young, Tech-Savvy Consumers: Younger respondents, typically in their 20s and 30s, showed a stronger preference for online research. They were more likely to use multiple online platforms and spend significant time comparing options before visiting stores. For example, Aishwarya and Nikhil (Interview 12), both software engineers in their 30s, extensively used YouTube and online reviews before making their decision. Middle-Aged and Older Consumers: Older respondents and those with less technological inclination tended to rely more heavily on offline sources. They often preferred visiting stores directly and valued the ability to physically test the mattresses. The couple from Interview 1, both in their 30s, primarily relied on store visits and recommendations from the shopkeeper. Working Professionals: Respondents with demanding jobs, such as Meenu and Kiran (Interview 11), both working in the tech industry, often started their research online due to time constraints but still visited stores for final decision-making. Families with Children: Families with young children, like Jai and Nandita (Interview 4), considered factors such as durability and stain resistance, often relying on a combination of online research and in-store experiences to make their decision. 3. Patterns in the Information-Gathering Process Multi-Channel Approach: Most Kurlon customers adopted a multi-channel approach to gathering information. They typically started with online research to get a broad understanding of options and prices, followed by store visits to physically experience the products. This pattern was consistent across various demographic groups, although the emphasis on online versus offline sources varied. Focus on Specific Features: Customers often focused their research on specific features that were important to them. For instance, those with health concerns, like Balaji (Interview 15), specifically looked for ortho mattresses to address back pain issues. Brand Comparison: Many respondents, such as the couple from Interview 13, consistently compared a few key brands (often Kurlon, Sleepwell, and one or two others) throughout their research process. Budget-Driven Research: Most customers had a specific budget in mind and tailored their research accordingly. For example, the respondents in Interview 11 had a budget of around 22,000-25,000 rupees, which influenced their brand and model choices. Reliance on Personal Experience: Many customers, like those in Interview 7, based their decisions on personal experiences with mattresses at friends' or relatives' homes, incorporating these experiences into their research process. This structured analysis highlights the diverse approaches Kurlon customers take in their mattress purchasing journey, emphasizing the importance of both online and offline resources across different demographic segments. Quotes By Respondents "If you search on you tube then you will find it." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when asked about how they researched mattress options) "On Amazon, Flipkart, there are mattress, electronics items, sometimes we are exposed to prices, online prices, offline prices, the more the difference the more we think the more we try. Secondly, what are the reviews? We are purchasing The shopkeeper is saying that it is comfortable but what are the reviews? What are the customer reviews? Is it better or not better?" (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when explaining how they researched mattresses online) "From Laxmi Nagar to Shankar Vihar, there are 7-8 multi-brand stores. I searched in 8-10 places. [...] I collected information about the most popular brands. There are around 20 brands for Kurlon and 8-10 brands for Sleep." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when describing her mattress search process) "In case of offline we can touch it and have a look at it and then buy it." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when explaining why they preferred buying from a physical store) "Probably the biggest thing missing online is the ability to touch and feel the product. I might like something online, but I want to experience it physically before purchasing." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when discussing the limitations of online research) "To some extent we got to know, like basic we got to know that these are the things that will be there. then when we go to showroom, those showroom people will have more knowledge as they will be dealing in it on daily basis. So, there we got even more knowledge." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, describing their research process, nikhil explained) "Then we had talked to our relatives and asked them which brands that they used. Then they suggested us as well." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, explaining how they sought recommendations) "With local, non-branded mattresses, you don't always know the quality or the chemicals used in the foam, which can affect your skin. This is especially important if kids are sleeping on it. Brands follow quality checks and standards, which gives peace of mind." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when discussing the importance of brands for mattresses) "When we talk to someone in a shop, we can ask them 10 questions, and they'll give us 100 answers. Online, it's not the same. You can't ask detailed questions. We have to search and figure things out ourselves. If you go to a shop, you can directly see and touch the products. Online doesn't offer that experience." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when explaining why online shopping wasn't satisfactory) "The thickness and layers were very important. Over time, mattresses tend to become thinner, so we wanted a thick one that would last. Comfort and softness come from the layers, and good sleep can even help with back pain, so that was a priority too." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when asked about the most important factors in choosing a mattress) In-Store Experience Impact Key Takeaways In-store experiences and salesperson interactions play a vital role in the final purchase decision for Kurlon products, often serving as the tipping point even for customers who begin their search online. The ability to physically examine products, receive personalized recommendations, and gain immediate answers to queries significantly influences customer confidence and decision-making. The importance of these factors varies across customer segments, with budget-conscious, health-focused, and family decision-makers placing higher value on in-store experiences and salesperson interactions. Younger, tech- savvy customers, while conducting extensive online research, still rely on physical store visits for final validation. To maximize the effectiveness of in-store experiences and salesperson interactions, Kurlon should: 1. Invest in comprehensive training for sales staff, ensuring they can provide expert advice on product features, health benefits, and suitability for different customer needs. 2. Create inviting in-store environments that encourage product testing and comparison. 3. Develop targeted strategies for different customer segments, balancing online information with compelling reasons to visit physical stores. 4. Implement policies like trial periods or return guarantees to build customer confidence and leverage the trust- building role of in-store experiences. By focusing on these areas, Kurlon can enhance the impact of in-store experiences and salesperson interactions on purchase decisions across various customer segments. Synthesized Insights The in-store experience and salesperson interactions play a crucial role in the final purchase decision for Kurlon products across various customer segments. This analysis reveals that while many customers conduct initial research online, the physical store visit often becomes the deciding factor in their mattress purchase journey. 1. Impact of In-Store Experiences on Final Purchase Decisions Physical Examination of Products: The ability to physically interact with mattresses emerges as a primary driver for in-store purchases. Multiple respondents emphasized the importance of touching, feeling, and testing mattresses before making a decision. For example, one respondent stated, "In offline stores, they could touch and look at the mattress before buying it" (Interview 10). This sentiment was echoed across various interviews, highlighting the tactile nature of mattress shopping. Comparison and Variety: In-store experiences allow customers to compare different mattress options side-by-side, which is challenging to replicate online. Respondents appreciated the ability to see and feel the differences between various models and brands. One interviewee mentioned visiting "2-3 local mattress shops in person to inquire about options and prices" (Interview 8), underscoring the value of physical stores in providing a comprehensive shopping experience. Immediate Gratification and Confidence: The in-store experience provides immediate answers to customer queries and allows for on-the-spot decision- making. As one respondent noted, they preferred visiting a physical store where they could "ask detailed questions, touch and feel the products, and get immediate answers from salespeople" (Interview 15). This immediacy builds confidence in the purchase decision. 2. Role of Salesperson Interactions in Purchase Decisions Product Knowledge and Recommendations: Salesperson interactions significantly influence customer decisions through their product knowledge and personalized recommendations. Many respondents relied on salespeople to guide them towards suitable options based on their specific needs. For instance, one customer mentioned that the "shopkeeper understood their needs quickly, recommended a suitable mattress within their budget, and offered assurance" (Interview 8). Trust and Assurance: Salespeople play a crucial role in building trust and providing assurance to customers. Several respondents mentioned feeling more confident in their purchase due to the salesperson's guidance and guarantees. One interviewee highlighted how the salesperson's recommendation and "assurance in the form of a 7-day return/replace policy" influenced their decision (Interview 8). Additional Information and Clarification: Salespeople provide valuable additional information that may not be readily available online or in product descriptions. For example, one respondent appreciated that the salesperson "provided information about the foam quality and different names for the foam" (Interview 13), helping them make a more informed decision. 3. Variation in Importance Across Customer Segments Age and Tech-Savviness: Younger, more tech-savvy customers tend to conduct more extensive online research before visiting stores. However, even this segment often relies on in-store experiences for final validation. For instance, a 27-year-old respondent mentioned first searching online but ultimately choosing to visit offline stores to "physically feel the product" (Interview 14). Budget-Conscious vs. Premium Seekers: Budget-conscious customers appear to value in-store experiences and salesperson interactions more heavily, as they seek to maximize value within their constraints. These customers often appreciate salespeople who can guide them towards the best options within their budget. In contrast, premium seekers may be more influenced by brand reputation and specific features, using in-store visits to confirm their pre-existing preferences. Health-Focused Customers: Customers with specific health concerns, such as back pain, tend to place higher importance on salesperson expertise. One respondent with back pain issues particularly valued the salesperson's recommendation of an ortho mattress (Interview 15). For this segment, the ability to discuss health-related concerns with knowledgeable staff is crucial. Family Decision-Makers: Families making joint decisions often value the in-store experience more, as it allows all decision-makers to test and agree on a choice. One couple mentioned visiting stores together to ensure the mattress suited both their needs (Interview 12). Brand Loyalists vs. New Customers: Customers with prior positive experiences with Kurlon may be less influenced by in-store experiences and salesperson interactions, as they already trust the brand. New customers or those switching from other brands tend to rely more heavily on these factors to build confidence in their choice. This structured presentation highlights the key findings and insights regarding the importance of in-store experiences and salesperson interactions in the purchasing decisions of Kurlon customers.

However, online channels play a crucial role in the research phase of the customer journey, particularly for price comparisons and initial product exploration. To cater to these preferences, Kurlon could consider implementing an omnichannel strategy that leverages online platforms for information dissemination and initial engagement while emphasizing the in-store experience for final purchase decisions.

This sentiment is consistent across different age groups, from younger customers in their 20s and 30s to older customers in their 40s. For example, Aishwarya and Nikhil (both software engineers in their 30s) and Balaji (a 47-year-old system engineer) all chose to buy their mattresses from physical stores. 1.2 Online Channels for Research, Offline for Purchase While customers prefer offline purchases, many utilize online channels for initial research. This hybrid approach is exemplified by respondents like Meenu and Kiran, who checked Amazon for product details before visiting physical stores. Similarly, Bindu Sri and Nagraj used online platforms like Amazon and Flipkart to narrow down options based on their budget and requirements before visiting offline stores. 1.3 Limited Trust in Online Mattress Purchases There is a general skepticism towards buying mattresses online without physical inspection. Neha, for instance, had a negative experience with an online mattress purchase, stating that she didn't like it after it arrived and swelled up. This experience reinforces the preference for offline purchases among many customers. 2. Reasons for Preferring Offline Purchases 2.1 Tactile Experience The most frequently cited reason for preferring offline purchases is the ability to physically experience the mattress. Respondents consistently mention the importance of touching, feeling, and lying down on the mattress before making a decision. Bindu Sri and Nagraj explicitly stated that for mattresses, it's crucial to physically feel the product to see how it suits their body. 2.2 Immediate Feedback and Information Customers value the ability to get immediate answers to their questions from salespeople in physical stores. Balaji, for example, preferred visiting a physical store where he could ask detailed questions and get immediate answers from salespeople. 2.3 Confidence in Purchase Decision The ability to physically test the mattress gives customers more confidence in their purchase decision. Aishwarya and Nikhil chose to buy offline because they preferred the ability to directly contact the store if any issues arose, rather than dealing with online customer service. 2.4 Better Deals and Services Some respondents found better deals in physical stores compared to online platforms. Aishwarya and Nikhil mentioned that the showroom offered better deals than online, including exchange offers for their old bed and home delivery and installation services. 3. Role of Online Channels in the Purchase Journey 3.1 Initial Research Online platforms play a crucial role in the initial research phase. Many respondents, like Vaishali and Kamal, used Google to search for mattress information and compare prices. YouTube was also mentioned as a source of information, with respondents like Aishwarya and Nikhil watching videos to learn about different types of mattresses and materials. 3.2 Price Comparison Customers often use online channels to compare prices before visiting physical stores. Vaishali and Kamal, for instance, checked online sites like Amazon and Flipkart to compare prices with market rates. 3.3 Reading Reviews Online customer reviews are an important source of information for many customers. Vaishali and Kamal mentioned reading customer reviews online as part of their research process. 4. Demographic Variations in Attitudes and Preferences 4.1 Age and Tech-Savviness While there is a general preference for offline purchases across age groups, younger and more tech-savvy customers tend to engage more extensively with online research. For example, Meenu (26) and Kiran (30) conducted thorough online research before visiting stores, whereas older respondents like Balaji (47) primarily relied on in-store experiences. 4.2 Urban vs. Semi-Urban Respondents from more urban areas, like Bangalore, seemed more comfortable with online research and considering online purchases. In contrast, respondents from semi-urban areas showed a stronger preference for traditional offline shopping methods. 4.3 Occupation and Education Respondents with technology-related occupations, such as software engineers, appeared more inclined to use online resources extensively in their research process. However, even these tech-savvy customers ultimately preferred offline purchases for mattresses. This structured format enhances readability and allows for easier navigation through the key points of the analysis. Quotes By Respondents "In case of offline we can touch it and have a look at it and then buy it." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when explaining why they preferred buying from a physical store) "She searched online, but I didn't prefer buying online.

I looked at the sizes available, the types of foam used, and whether they were antibacterial or not. It was important to get an idea of the price range. Online research helped us narrow down the options based on our budget." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when describing how they researched mattress options) "Showroom people were giving better offer than the online. If anything happens then we can directly contact them. in case of online we have to call customer-care and talk to them. and we don't know as to how it will work in case of beds." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when asked why they didn't buy online, nikhil explained:) "On Amazon, Flipkart, there are mattress, electronics items, sometimes we are exposed to prices, online prices, offline prices, the more the difference the more we think the more we try.

(From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when discussing important factors in choosing a mattress) "When we talk to someone in a shop, we can ask them 10 questions, and they'll give us 100 answers. Online, it's not the same. You can't ask detailed questions. We have to search and figure things out ourselves. If you go to a shop, you can directly see and touch the products. Online doesn't offer that experience." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when explaining why online shopping wasn't satisfactory) "We also found out about in-store discounts and credit card offers, which weren't available online." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when discussing additional benefits of buying in-store) Channel Impact On Customer Behavior Key Takeaways The research reveals that a multi-channel approach, combining online research with offline purchasing, significantly impacts customer satisfaction, decision-making, and brand loyalty for Kurlon mattresses. While online channels play a crucial role in the initial stages of the customer journey, the ability to physically experience the product in-store remains a key factor in final purchase decisions and overall satisfaction. To leverage these insights, Kurlon should focus on: 1. Enhancing their online presence with detailed product information, customer reviews, and educational content about mattress selection. 2. Improving the integration between online and offline channels to provide a seamless customer experience. 3. Investing in in-store experiences that allow customers to thoroughly test and compare mattresses. 4. Developing a robust omnichannel customer support system to maintain high satisfaction levels and foster brand loyalty. By addressing these areas, Kurlon can optimize its multi-channel strategy to better meet customer needs and preferences, ultimately leading to increased satisfaction, more informed decision-making, and stronger brand loyalty. Synthesized Insights The analysis of customer interviews reveals that both online and offline channels play significant roles in the research and purchasing process for Kurlon mattresses. However, there is a clear preference for offline purchasing, despite the increasing use of online platforms for initial research. This combination of channels impacts customer satisfaction, decision-making processes, and brand loyalty in various ways. 1. Impact on Customer Satisfaction Online Research: Many customers begin their mattress search online, using platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and YouTube. This initial research helps them gather information about brands, prices, and features. For example, one respondent mentioned, "I checked rates, brands, and ratings on Amazon. I also searched on YouTube for information about which mattress brands were better and their uses." This online research phase allows customers to feel more informed and confident when they eventually make a purchase. Offline Purchase Experience: Despite the convenience of online research, the majority of customers prefer to purchase mattresses offline. This preference stems from the desire to physically experience the product before buying. As one respondent stated, "In offline stores, they could touch and look at the mattress before buying it." This tactile experience leads to higher satisfaction levels, as customers can ensure the mattress meets their comfort needs. Post-Purchase Satisfaction: Customers who purchased Kurlon mattresses after experiencing them in-store generally reported high satisfaction levels. Many respondents rated their Kurlon mattresses 9 or 10 out of 10 for comfort. This high satisfaction can be attributed to the ability to test the mattress before purchase, which is not possible with online buying. 2. Impact on Decision-Making Process Multi-Channel Approach: Most customers adopt a multi-channel approach in their decision-making process. They typically start with online research to gather information and narrow down options, then visit physical stores to make the final decision. This approach allows for a more informed and confident purchase decision. Online Influence: Online channels significantly influence the initial stages of decision-making. Customers use online platforms to compare prices, read reviews, and learn about different mattress types and brands. One respondent mentioned, "I searched on YouTube for 'Best quality mattress' and 'Best Indian mattress'. I also checked prices on Amazon and read online reviews about different brands." Offline Conversion: While online research is crucial, the final decision is often made in-store. Factors like the ability to physically test the mattress, interact with salespeople, and negotiate prices play a significant role in the final purchase decision. One customer noted, "We preferred to visit a physical store where we could ask detailed questions, touch and feel the products, and get immediate answers from salespeople." 3. Influence on Brand Loyalty Brand Awareness: Online channels contribute significantly to brand awareness. Many customers first encounter Kurlon through online searches and advertisements. This online presence helps establish Kurlon as a reputable brand in customers' minds before they even visit a store. Trust Building: The combination of online research and offline purchase experiences helps build trust in the Kurlon brand. Customers appreciate the consistency between online information and in-store experiences, which reinforces their trust in the brand. Post-Purchase Support: The availability of both online and offline support channels contributes to brand loyalty. Customers value the option to contact physical stores for immediate support while also having access to online resources. This multi-channel support system enhances the overall customer experience and encourages brand loyalty. 4. Challenges and Opportunities Online-Offline Integration: While customers appreciate the ability to research online and purchase offline, there's an opportunity for Kurlon to better integrate these experiences. Some customers mentioned a disconnect between online information and in-store offerings, suggesting room for improvement in creating a seamless omnichannel experience. Personalization: The offline purchasing experience allows for personalized recommendations from salespeople, which customers value highly. There's an opportunity for Kurlon to enhance this personalization by integrating online data with in-store experiences, providing even more tailored recommendations to customers.

(From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when discussing qualities of a good mattress) "A good mattress should be soft but not too soft. It should have enough firmness to support you.

Even if you don't get relaxation, whether it is one thousand rupees or ten lakhs. If you get comfort in a thousand, you will not go for ten lakhs.

However, nuanced differences exist in how various customer groups perceive and respond to Kurlon's value propositions and pricing strategies. 1. Price Point Receptiveness Kurlon customers generally exhibit high receptiveness to the brand's current price points, viewing them as offering good value for money. This is evident across multiple interviews: Budget-conscious consumers: Interviewees like Abhijeet and Supriya (Interview 7), who paid around 18,000 rupees for their Kurlon Ortho Magic mattress, found the price reasonable for the quality offered. Similarly, Neha (Interview 9) negotiated a 30% discount on her Kurlon mattress, indicating price sensitivity but also a willingness to invest in quality. Mid-range buyers: Respondents such as Arun and Jyoti (Interview 5) paid 14,000 rupees for their Kurlon mattress, considering it a good balance of quality and affordability. This price point is particularly attractive to middle-class consumers seeking reliable, branded products. Premium segment: Some customers, like Balaji (Interview 15), were willing to spend up to 25,000 rupees on a Kurlon mattress, suggesting that the brand also appeals to those seeking higher-end products within their range. However, there is a ceiling to price tolerance. For instance, Meenu and Kiran (Interview 11) mentioned that if Sleepwell were to offer more affordable options, they might consider switching from Kurlon, indicating that maintaining competitive pricing is crucial for customer retention. 2. Value Propositions Across Demographic Segments Different demographic segments respond to various value propositions offered by Kurlon: Young professionals: Represented by respondents like Aishwarya and Nikhil (Interview 12), key value propositions include comfort, addressing specific health concerns (e.g., back pain), and the balance between quality and affordability. Families with children: Respondents like Prasenjit and Monimala Saha (Interview 1) value durability, ease of maintenance, and features like water resistance. They appreciate Kurlon's range of options catering to different family members' needs. Older consumers: For this segment, represented by respondents like Srinivas Reddy and Kavitha (Interview 10), the orthopaedic benefits, brand legacy, and long-term durability are crucial value propositions. Budget-conscious buyers: Across various age groups, many respondents like Deepankar and Sujata Rai (Interview 2) appreciate Kurlon's ability to offer quality products at accessible price points, making it an attractive option for value-seeking consumers. 3. Price Sensitivity Across Customer Segments Price sensitivity varies across different customer segments: Middle-class families: This segment, represented by respondents like Lokesh and Shakti (Interview 6), shows moderate price sensitivity. They are willing to invest in quality but actively seek discounts and compare prices across brands. Young couples: Respondents like Divya and Chirag (Interview 8) set specific budgets (around 15,000 rupees in their case) and are price-conscious but willing to stretch for perceived quality and brand value. Aspirational buyers: Some respondents, like Neha (Interview 9), who paid 50,000 rupees for two mattresses, demonstrate lower price sensitivity when it comes to branded products they perceive as high-quality and status- enhancing. Value-seekers: A significant portion of Kurlon's customer base, represented by respondents like Subham and Payel Debnath (Interview 3), actively seek value for money, comparing Kurlon favorably to more expensive brands like Sleepwell. 4. Strategic Opportunities Based on the analysis, several strategic opportunities emerge for Kurlon: Tiered pricing strategy: Kurlon could benefit from a clearly defined tiered pricing strategy that caters to different segments, from budget-conscious buyers to premium seekers. This would allow them to capture a wider market share while maintaining their value proposition across segments. Health-focused marketing: Many respondents, like Balaji (Interview 15), chose Kurlon for its orthopaedic benefits. Emphasizing these health-related features could strengthen Kurlon's position in the market, especially among older consumers and those with specific health concerns. Customization options: Some respondents, like Bindu Sri and Nagraj (Interview 14), expressed interest in specific features like antibacterial properties. Offering customizable options could appeal to customers willing to pay more for personalized solutions. Bundle deals and discounts: Many respondents, such as Neha (Interview 9), actively sought discounts. Implementing strategic bundle deals or seasonal discounts could help Kurlon attract price-sensitive customers without compromising their overall price positioning. Enhanced in-store experience: Several respondents, including Aishwarya and Nikhil (Interview 12), valued the ability to physically test mattresses before purchase. Improving the in-store experience could further differentiate Kurlon from online-only competitors. Quotes By Respondents "Premium brand. R: Best quality, Kurlon is old brand. Also price range matters, it was Rs14000." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when explaining why they chose kurlon) "Yes, I've thought about it. The first one is the brand, then price, then durability. After that, it's softness and hardness, followed by the material. Then come the offers, color choice, stitching, and finally, the design." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when ranking the factors they considered when choosing a mattress) "I wanted to use something branded since childhood, plus he also told that he has used it in his uncle's marriage, then we discussed and decided to buy it." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when discussing factors that influenced their purchase decision) "The first thing is that if it is a brand, then it takes a little time to get faith. You know that there is an issue in warranty periods, and you will be covered. So first of all, this is the brand. Second is comfort. Even if you don't get relaxation, whether it is one thousand rupees or ten lakhs. If you get comfort in a thousand, you will not go for ten lakhs. So comfort is the main thing, you should buy and sell for your comfort. Third is price. If you allow the pocket to be in the range of the pocket, then only you can pick up the stuff." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when explaining why he ranked brand, comfort, and price as the top three factors) "Kurlon fits the budget.

Online doesn't offer that experience."

[...] Yes. we are not from AC culture and so, when we put fan, we should be able to adjust to that." (From Unit 19-BKO3-35-45-NCCS B1-Offline buyer-Kurl on, when discussing important features of a mattress) "With local, non-branded mattresses, you don't always know the quality or the chemicals used in the foam, which can affect your skin. This is especially important if kids are sleeping on it. Brands follow quality checks and standards, which gives peace of mind."

Synthesized Insights The analysis of interview data reveals several opportunities for Kurlon to enhance its market share by addressing the unmet needs of specific customer segments and underserved demographics. Insights from the interviews highlight consumer preferences, pain points, and perceptions of mattress brands that Kurlon can leverage to strengthen its market positioning and capture a larger share of the mattress market. 1. Addressing Health and Wellness Concerns Unmet Need: Many interviewees expressed concerns about health issues related to sleep, particularly back pain, neck pain, and cervical problems. There is a clear demand for mattresses that can alleviate these issues. Opportunity: Kurlon could expand its range of orthopedic and health-focused mattresses, positioning them more prominently in their product lineup. For example: Develop a line of mattresses specifically designed for different health concerns (e.g., back pain, neck pain, pregnancy). Partner with healthcare professionals to create medically-endorsed mattress options. Offer customizable mattresses that can be adjusted for firmness or support in specific areas. Strategy: Launch a targeted marketing campaign highlighting the health benefits of Kurlon's specialized mattresses, using testimonials from customers who have experienced relief from pain or improved sleep quality. This could help Kurlon capture a larger share of the health-conscious consumer segment. 2. Serving Tech-Savvy Young Professionals Unmet Need: Several younger interviewees, particularly those working in IT or corporate jobs, expressed interest in mattresses that incorporate technology or innovative features. Opportunity: Kurlon could develop a new product line targeting tech-savvy young professionals, incorporating features such as: Smart mattresses with sleep tracking capabilities. Temperature-regulating technology for improved comfort. Mattresses with built-in charging ports or other tech-friendly features. Strategy: Partner with tech companies or startups to develop innovative mattress technologies. Launch a digital-first marketing campaign on platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn to reach young professionals. This could help Kurlon capture market share from newer, tech-focused brands like Wakefit. 3. Addressing Climate Concerns Unmet Need: Some interviewees mentioned issues with mattresses heating up, particularly in warm climates without air conditioning. Opportunity: Kurlon could develop a line of climate-adaptive mattresses specifically designed for different weather conditions in India. This could include: Mattresses with enhanced breathability and cooling properties for hot climates. Mattresses with moisture-wicking capabilities for humid regions. Dual-season mattresses with different sides optimized for summer and winter. Strategy: Launch region-specific marketing campaigns highlighting how Kurlon mattresses are designed to provide optimal comfort in local climate conditions. This could help Kurlon differentiate itself from competitors and capture market share in regions where climate-related sleep issues are common. 4. Catering to Joint Families and Multigenerational Households Unmet Need: Several interviewees lived in joint families or multigenerational households, where different family members may have varying mattress preferences and needs. Opportunity: Kurlon could develop mattress solutions specifically designed for joint families, such as: Modular mattresses that can be customized for different sections of the bed. Mattresses with varying firmness levels on different sides. Family-size mattresses with enhanced durability for multiple users. Strategy: Create marketing campaigns that resonate with joint families, emphasizing how Kurlon mattresses can meet the diverse needs of different family members. Partner with furniture retailers to offer complete bedroom solutions for large families. This could help Kurlon capture a larger share of the family-oriented market segment. 5. Enhancing the Budget-Friendly Range Unmet Need: While many interviewees praised Kurlon's affordability, some still found the prices challenging, particularly for larger mattress sizes. Opportunity: Kurlon could expand its budget-friendly range without compromising on quality, potentially through: Introducing a "basics" line with essential features at lower price points. Offering more competitive pricing on larger mattress sizes. Developing innovative, cost-effective materials to reduce production costs. Strategy: Launch a marketing campaign emphasizing Kurlon's commitment to making quality sleep accessible to all income levels. Introduce flexible payment options or partnerships with fintech companies to offer easy EMIs. This could help Kurlon capture market share from local, unbranded mattress sellers and expand its presence in price-sensitive segments. 6. Improving In-Store Experience Unmet Need: Some interviewees mentioned that Kurlon's in-store experience could be improved, particularly in terms of store layout and product presentation. Opportunity: Kurlon could enhance its retail presence by: Redesigning stores to create a more inviting and interactive shopping experience. Introducing "sleep zones" where customers can test mattresses in simulated bedroom environments. Providing better training to sales staff to offer personalized recommendations based on customer needs. Strategy: Invest in upgrading flagship stores in key markets and train staff to provide expert sleep consultations. This could help Kurlon differentiate itself from online-only brands and capture customers who prefer a physical retail experience. By addressing these opportunities, Kurlon can effectively enhance its market share and better meet the diverse needs of its customers. Quotes By Respondents "When I was expecting I had back pain, so I told him that we have to be in check, because if I have back pain from this age, it will increase more later.
